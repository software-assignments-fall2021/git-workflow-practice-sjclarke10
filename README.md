[Influential Women in Tech](https://whatis.techtarget.com/feature/Top-9-most-influential-women-in-technology)

<p>This article highlights nine women who are making history in tech/software engineering right now. I know that in recent days the difference in the number of women and men in tech has beem getting smaller and smaller. There are more women in technology than ever and I am interseted in learning about the big, monumental changes that these women who are joining/have been working in technology have been working on. What was interesting to me was when reading about Kimerly Bryant and how she founded "Black Girls Code", she mentioned that part of the reason that many people don't get into technology is that when we are young there is not much exposure to it in schools. Bryant wanted to expose girls to the world of technology at a young age so they can consider it as a career path. When I was in high school I had very little exposure to STEM/technology courses and I wish I had so I could have began learning and found my passion for tech sooner. </p>

<p>The article highlights other women with insipring stories, including Kate Crawford who founded NYU's AI Now institute. This article licks to an article co-authored by Crawford, 
https://ainowinstitute.org/discriminatingsystems.pdf, about AI and discusses the lack of diversity in the production of AI. <p>
